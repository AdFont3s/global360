# Global360 — Auto-Healing Web Tier

Self-healing, N+1 web tier on AWS using Terraform. Terminating any single instance triggers automatic replacement with zero downtime.

---

## Why AWS

AWS was chosen for its mature Auto Scaling + ALB ecosystem, the widest free-tier offering (750 hrs/month of t3.micro), and ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) proximity for AUD cost estimation. The ASG + ELB health-check combination is battle-tested for exactly this pattern.

## How Self-Healing Works

1. An EC2 instance crashes or is manually terminated.
2. The ALB marks it unhealthy after 2 failed health checks (~30 s) and stops routing traffic to it.
3. The ASG detects the unhealthy instance and terminates it.
4. A replacement instance is launched in the same or alternate AZ; user-data runs automatically.
5. Once the new instance passes health checks the ALB adds it back to rotation.

At `min_size = 2` with instances spread across two AZs, the surviving instance handles all traffic while the replacement starts — no downtime.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.9
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`) with permissions for VPC, EC2, ALB, and ASG
- Docker (only needed for the optional image build/push step)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd terraform

# 1. Initialise providers and modules
terraform init

# 2. Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# 3. Deploy
terraform apply
```

After apply, the ALB DNS name is printed as `alb_dns_name`. Open it in a browser — the page is served by NGINX running inside Docker on each instance.

To verify self-healing:

```bash
# Terminate one instance via the AWS console or CLI
aws autoscaling terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group \
  --instance-id <id> --should-decrement-desired-capacity false

# Watch the ASG replace it
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups \
  --auto-scaling-group-names global360-prod-asg \
  --query 'AutoScalingGroups[0].Instances[*].{ID:InstanceId,State:LifecycleState}'
```

---

## Bonus: Docker Image

The `docker/` directory contains a minimal NGINX image serving a custom page.

**Build and push to GitHub Container Registry:**

```bash
cd docker

docker build -t ghcr.io/<your-github-username>/global360-web:latest .

echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-github-username> --password-stdin

docker push ghcr.io/<your-github-username>/global360-web:latest
```

Each EC2 instance pulls this image on first boot via user-data. If the registry is unreachable, user-data falls back to installing NGINX directly so the instance is never left without a web server.

Update the image reference in `terraform/modules/compute/main.tf` to match your registry path before applying.

## Configuration

All tuneable values are in `terraform/variables.tf` and overridden via `terraform/terraform.tfvars`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `project_name` | `global360` | Prefix for all resource names and tags |
| `environment` | `prod` | Environment tag |
| `aws_region` | `ap-southeast-2` | Deployment region |
| `instance_type` | `t3.micro` | EC2 instance type |
| `asg_min` | `2` | Minimum instances |
| `asg_max` | `4` | Maximum instances |
| `asg_desired` | `2` | Desired instances |

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

`.github/workflows/terraform.yml` runs on every push and pull request touching `terraform/**`.

| Job | Trigger | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| `validate` | all pushes + PRs | `fmt -check` → `init -backend=false` → `validate` |
| `plan` | push to non-main branch + PR | AWS credentials → `init` → `plan` → post output as PR comment |
| `apply` | push to `main` (PR merged) | AWS credentials → `init` → `apply -auto-approve` |

The `apply` job uses a `production` GitHub environment — configure it in repo settings to add a manual approval gate before apply runs.

Required secrets: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`.

## Assumptions

- **Local state** — no S3 backend configured; add one for team use.
- **Single NAT Gateway** — one NAT GW in AZ-a to minimise cost. A second NAT GW in AZ-b would eliminate the AZ-dependency for outbound traffic but doubles the NAT cost.
- **No bastion / SSH** — instances are in private subnets with SSH denied at the NACL level. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for shell access if needed.
- **HTTP only (port 80)** — the ALB currently listens on port 80 for simplicity. I'm fully aware this can be switched to HTTPS (port 443) by adding an ACM certificate and updating the ALB listener. This would add a small cost (~$0–$1 AUD/month per certificate via ACM, plus any Route 53 DNS hosting if required) but is the right approach for production.
- **Free tier** — cost estimate below assumes outside free tier. New AWS accounts get 750 hrs/month of t3.micro free for 12 months.

## Estimated Monthly Cost (AUD, ap-southeast-2, outside free tier)

| Resource | Unit cost | Qty | AUD/month |
|---|---|---|---|
| EC2 t3.micro | ~$0.023 AUD/hr | 2 × 730 hr | ~$33 |
| ALB | ~$0.034 AUD/hr + LCU | 1 | ~$25 |
| NAT Gateway | ~$0.089 AUD/hr + data | 1 | ~$65 |
| EIP (attached) | $0 | 1 | $0 |
| **Total** | | | **~$123** |

With the 12-month free tier, EC2 cost drops to ~$0, bringing the total to ~$90 AUD/month (NAT + ALB).

### Cost-optimised alternative

Replace the NAT Gateway with an Internet Gateway and move EC2 instances into public subnets with public IPs. Inbound traffic is still restricted to the ALB security group — only outbound internet access changes. This eliminates ~$65 AUD/month, dropping the total to **~$58 AUD/month** (~$25 with free tier).

| Resource | AUD/month |
|---|---|
| EC2 t3.micro ×2 | ~$33 |
| ALB | ~$25 |
| Internet Gateway | $0 |
| **Total** | **~$58** |
